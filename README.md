Hands On Machine Learning - Code from the book 
This project is about learning to use Python for machine learning using libraries 
including keras, scikitlearn, tensorflow and associated libraries like pandas and matplotlib

Hopefully also interesting data examples will enter the picture
It's always a benefit of doing machine learning to encounter interesting datasets
